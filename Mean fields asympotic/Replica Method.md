# Lecuture 8 Field theoretic calculations & Large deviations
## Large deviation of overlap matrix and field theoretic calculations

Consider $\sigma_{1}, \dots, \sigma_{k} \in \mathbb{R^n}$  k is fixed and  $n \to \infty$
We let all $\sigma_{i}$ be i.i.d $Unif(S^{n-1}(\sqrt{ n }))$  consider $\sigma$:
$$
\sigma = [\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{}{2}, \dots, \sigma_{k}{}] 
$$
$$
\bar{Q}(\sigma) = \frac{\sigma^{T}\sigma}{n} \in \mathbb{R^{k \times k}} 
$$
Then we consider $Q \in \mathbb{R^{k \times k}}$ , which is symmetric matrix with diagonals entries are all $1$ 

Then $P(\bar{Q}(\sigma) \approx Q)$
