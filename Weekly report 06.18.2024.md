## Paper reading 
I have been reading the main parts of this paper：**The Power of Contrast for Feature Learning: A Theoretical Analysis**  And I am currently working on the proof parts of this paper. Here is the summary of what I have read:

### Review of contrasive learning
There are two common approaches for feature extraction I am not familar with contrasive learning. So I read the SimCLR work.

1. A stochastic data augmentation that transforms the data into a positive pair
2. A neural network base encoder f (·) that extracts representation vectors from augmented data examples
3. A small neural network projection head g(·) that maps representations to the space (smaller dimension)
4. A contrastive loss function defined for a contrastive prediction task
In this paper, the second part is based on ResNet (He et al., 2016).

## Theoretical Analysis of Contrasive learning

In this paper, a theoretical framework is established to study contrastive learning under **the linear representation setting**. They provide a theoretical analysis on the **spiked covariance model** and theoretically justify why contrastive learning outperforms **standard autoencoders** and **generative adversarial networks (GANs)** 
Conclusion: contrastive learning is able to remove more noise by constructing contrastive samples via augmentations.
## Model Setup
### Linear Representation Settings

Given an input  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , contrastive learning aims to learn a low-dimensional representation $h = f(x; \theta) \in \mathbb{R}^r$ by contrasting different samples, that is, maximizing the agreement between positive pairs, and minimizing the agreement between negative pairs. Suppose we have $n$ data points  $X = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ . The contrastive learning task can be formulated to the following optimization problem: 
$$
\min_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \min_\theta \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(x_i, \mathcal{B}_i^{\text{Pos}}, \mathcal{B}_i^{\text{Neg}}; f(\cdot; \theta)) + \lambda R(\theta),
$$
### Linear contrasive loss
$$ 
\ell(x, \mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Pos}}, \mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Neg}}, f(\cdot; \theta)) = - \sum_{x^{\text{Pos}} \in \mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Pos}}} \frac{\langle f(x, \theta), f(x^{\text{Pos}}, \theta) \rangle}{|\mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Pos}}|} + \sum_{x^{\text{Neg}} \in \mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Neg}}} \frac{\langle f(x, \theta), f(x^{\text{Neg}}, \theta) \rangle}{|\mathcal{B}_x^{\text{Neg}}|}
$$

### Generation for Augmented Pairs 
The loss function of the self-supervised contrastive learning problem can then be written as: 

$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{SelfCon}}(W) = - \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{v=1}^{2} \left[ \langle W g_v(x_i), W g_{[2] \setminus \{v\}}(x_i) \rangle - \sum_{j \neq i} \sum_{s=1}^{2} \frac{\langle W g_v(x_i), W g_s(x_j) \rangle}{2n - 2} \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|WW^{\top}\|_F^2.
$$
### Random Masking Augmentation
The two views of the original data are generated by randomly dividing its dimensions into two sets, that is, $g_1(x_i) = A x_i$, and $g_2(x_i) = (I - A) x_i$, where $A = \text{diag}(a_1, \ldots, a_d) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is the diagonal masking matrix with $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^{d}$ being i.i.d. random variables sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with mean \$1/2$ .
